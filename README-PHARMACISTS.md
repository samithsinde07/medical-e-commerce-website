# Pharmacist Accounts Setup

## Dummy Pharmacist Credentials

Three pharmacist accounts have been created for testing:

1. **Dr. Ramesh Kumar**
   - Email: `ramesh.pharma@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`

2. **Dr. Sneha Patel**
   - Email: `sneha.pharma@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`

3. **Dr. Arjun Mehta**
   - Email: `arjun.pharma@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Manual Registration (Recommended)
1. Go to the auth page and register each pharmacist using the credentials above
2. After registration, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to assign pharmacist roles:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT id, 'pharmacist'::app_role
FROM auth.users
WHERE email IN (
  'ramesh.pharma@example.com',
  'sneha.pharma@example.com',
  'arjun.pharma@example.com'
)
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

### Option 2: Using the Seed Script
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
3. Run: `npx tsx scripts/seed-pharmacists.ts`
4. Follow the SQL instructions printed by the script to assign roles
